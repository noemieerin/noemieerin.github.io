### NOTE OF INTENT ####
***
<br>

SCENE:<br/>
Exterior night. The sunny-side-up woman has been raped and murdered. She is lying on the ground behind a building. Bushes are leaning over her body and revive her as eternal flowers start rising from her two egg yolks. The resurrected headless woman will accomplish her revenge.

ATMOSPHERE:<br/>
It is a phantasmagorical, sinister, dreamlike and offset scene. The scene is bathed in a night blue hue with big dark shadows (the plants). The only touches of defined colour are the yellow of the egg yolks and the eternal flowers, as well as the ruby red shoes of the sunny-side-up woman. Plants are arching over the victim, echoing the aerial dynamic of the arches in the background.

LIGHTING:<br/>
Soft night light. One ray of moonlight enlightens the sunny-side-up woman and the eternal flowers.

MEDIUM:<br/>
Foamcore, bristol paper, paper, photocopy, coloured pencil, eternal flowers (*Helichrysum stoechas*), PVA glue.
