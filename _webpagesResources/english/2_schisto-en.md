<h2>Schistocephalus solidus</h2>

<br/><br/>
<h4>LIFE CYCLE IN THE WILD</h4>
<br>
The tapeworm *Schistocephalus solidus* (Müller, 1776) is a trophically transmitted pseudophyllidea cestode with a three-host complex life cycle. *Schistocephalus solidus* can infect different species of cyclopoid copepod (as first intermediate host) and fish-eating bird (as final host), but it is highly specific to its second intermediate host, the [three-spined stickleback](/en/science/resources/sticklebacks/){:target="_blank"} (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*). It is typically found in populations of lake sticklebacks.

The life cycle starts when a fish-eating bird (**host 3: final host**) infected with mature tapeworms disperse *S. solidus* eggs with their faeces. After two to three weeks in freshwater, the eggs hatch and release the free-swimming larval stage, **coracidium**, which has to be ingested by a cyclopoid copepods (**host 1: first intermediate host**) within a few hours to continue the cycle. Once established in the copepod’s haemocoel, *S. solidus* will develop into the **procercoid** larval stage and become infective to the next host within a few days. When a three-spined stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*; **host 2: second intermediate host**) feeds on an infected copepod, the procercoid penetrates the gut wall to establish in the fish’s body cavity. Through this process, the procercoid shades its outer tegument and develops into a **plerocercoid** stage, which will grow for several weeks in its intermediate host before becoming infective to its final host. Fish-eating birds preying on infected sticklebacks will complete the cycle, allowing the simultaneous hermaphrodite tapeworms to reproduce sexually (by self- or cross-fertilization) in the bird digestive tract.

<h4>LIFE CYCLE IN THE LAB</h4>
<br>
The entire life cycle of *Schistocephalus solidus* can be reproduced in the laboratory<sup>§</sup>.

<h4>1) Collection</h4>

Infected three-spined sticklebacks are sampled from the wild and brought to the laboratory. Fish are killed, with an overdose of anaesthetic or by sectioning the spine, to dissect out *S. solidus* plerocercoids from the body cavity. The plerocercoids are then placed in medium.

<h4>2) In vitro breeding</h4>

Plerocercoids are paired and enclosed into a mesh bag. The mesh bag is secured to the cap of a medium bottle, which is placed into a dark shaking water bath at +40°C. This reproduces the conditions of a bird digestive tract and the plerocercoids start to mature, mate and produce eggs that fall at the bottom of the medium bottle. Every day for a week, the eggs are collected, washed from the medium and stored in tap water at +4°C.

<h4>3) Copepod infection</h4>

Eggs are incubated for three weeks in the dark at +20°C. Coracidia are then triggered to hatch by a change in light regime. Coracidia can then be fed to lab-bred cyclopoid copepods. Starting from four days after parasite exposure, copepods can be check under a microscope for the presence of a developing procercoid to confirm infection.

<h4>4) Fish infection</h4>

Within two weeks in the copepod, procercoids are infective to three-spined sticklebacks. Infected copepods can be fed to lab-bred fish, completing the cycle!
